### Google Traffic Parser
A simple python script for fetching a list of routes and comparing current drive times with regular ones. Feel free to correct and contribute!


### How it works

The script is pretty straightforward: It fetches a list of routes on a regular interval and creates a csv with the traffic delays. Works well to gather some information on peak traffic times.
